Akka Project [Completed]

- FileReader actor is called with the path of the file to read in a FileWork.class by CounterMain
- it creates a RouterManager and send all the line of the file in a Work.class; finishing by sending EndOfFile.class.
- RouterManager creates a Worker at every Work received.
- If every workers are Terminated AND EnfOfFile has been received, it prints and close the program.
- Workers send the result Integer.class to RouterManager by calling getSender()::tell()

Issues:

- Terminating an Actor (just reading the documentation was enough)
- Understanding when to sum up all the workers results (EndOfFile + knowing how many workers are busy)
- RouterManager receives Work.class faster than Worker were Terminated and no mailbox were implemented
  Resulting in loosing messages because of no worker available.
  We chose to create a worker every Work.class received instead of implementing a Mailbox. (Not the goal of the project)

How to run:
mvn compiler:compile exec:java
